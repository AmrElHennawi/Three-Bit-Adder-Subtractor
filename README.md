# Three-Bit Adder-Subtractor in Verilog HDL

## Overview
This Verilog HDL code implements a three-bit adder-subtractor circuit using a combination of full adders, XOR gates, and multiplexers. The circuit takes two 3-bit signed integers (A and B) in 2's complement form and performs different operations based on the selection inputs (sel). The implemented operations include addition, subtraction, and increments.

## Components Used
The circuit is constructed using the following components:
- 6 4x1 Multiplexers
- 3 Full Adders
- 3 XOR Gates

## Test Bench
The `three_bit_adder_subtractor` contains a behavioral test bench with 40 test cases covering various input values. The test bench monitors the input and output signals and stops after the simulation is complete.
